                        <p class="mb-4 text-lg text-gray-600">Our project tackles the 13th SDG (sustainable development goal) which is climate change that's mainly
                            caused by pollution. Poor waste management plays a huge role in deteriorating the environment and
                            harming the life of many species including us, human beings.</p>
                        <p class="mb-4 text-lg text-gray-600">The solution that we came up with is a smart trash collector, which is an autonomous robot that moves
                            around and collects different types of trash by detecting them and putting them in a box integrated in
                            the robot itself. The garbage is detected by sensors and supported by an AI system that guides the
                            actuators. This project not only collects trash but also identifies its category to be able to sort it
                            by type (plastic, glass, paperâ€¦)</p>
            
                        <p class="mb-4 text-lg text-gray-600">The robot is connected to a mobile application that helps control it and display statistics about the
                            collected waste, as well as information about the robot's state.</p>
